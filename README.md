# Intro to Coding for Database
## Tech Lady Hackathon 2016 Workshop

This repository contains data, code, and slides for the Intro to Coding for Database course at the [Tech Lady Hackathon 2016](http://techladyhackathon.org/index).

The course is intended to briefly (45 minutes) introduce students to SQL. It was taught using the PostgreSQL 9.3 engine on [SQLFiddle](http://sqlfiddle.com/). 

You can do the same and learn entirely in your browser, try it with a different language, or even move to your favorite command line interface or other database-connected tool.
